    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I created this fettuccine Alfredo by modifying my mother's recipe. I get nothing but rave reviews when I make this dish. My girlfriend is a fettuccine Alfredo connoisseur, and he scrapes the pan every time. I must warn you, this recipe is not for the health-conscious!</p>
    <p>This rich and creamy fettuccine Alfredo is an easy recipe even for beginner cooks, but itâ€™s impressive enough for company. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pasta: Of course, you'll need fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>Butter: This alfredo sauce starts with two sticks of butter.</li>
        <li>Cream: The rich sauce calls for almost a cup of heavy cream.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: The fettuccine Alfredo is simply seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic salt.</li>
        <li>Cheese: You'll need Romano and Parmesan cheeses.</li>
    </ul>
